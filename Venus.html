    <h1>Space Missions to Venus</h1>

    <h3>Venera Series (Soviet Union)</h3>
    <p>The Venera program, launched by the Soviet Union, conducted numerous flybys, landings, and atmospheric probes between 1961 and 1984. Notable missions include Venera 7, the first successful landing on Venus in 1970, and Venera 13 and 14, which sent back the first images from the surface in 1982.</p>

    <h3>Pioneer Venus (NASA, 1978-1992)</h3>
    <p>The Pioneer Venus Orbiter studied Venus' atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetic field from orbit, while the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe consisted of four atmospheric probes that provided data on temperature, pressure, and composition of Venus' atmosphere during their descent.</p>

    <h3>Magellan (NASA, 1989-1994)</h3>
    <p>Magellan was launched in 1989 to map the surface of Venus using radar. It produced high-resolution images of about 98% of Venus' surface, revealing features such as volcanoes, impact craters, and vast plains.</p>

    <h3>Venus Express (ESA, 2005-2014)</h3>
    <p>Venus Express, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), studied Venus' atmosphere, surface, and plasma environment. It provided detailed measurements of atmospheric composition, temperature, and cloud dynamics.</p>

    <h3>Akatsuki (JAXA, 2010-Present)</h3>
    <p>Akatsuki, launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), aims to study Venus' atmosphere and climate. It successfully entered Venus' orbit in 2015 after a previous failed attempt and continues to study Venus' atmosphere and weather patterns.</p>

    <h3>Future Missions</h3>
    <p>Proposed future missions to Venus include VERITAS (NASA), aimed at mapping Venus' surface, and DAVINCI+ (NASA), which will study Venus' atmosphere and surface composition in detail.</p>
