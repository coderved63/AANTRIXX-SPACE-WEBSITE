      <h2>Parker Solar Probe (NASA)</h2>
      <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> August 12, 2018</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The Parker Solar Probe aims to study the Sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, and investigate the solar wind and solar energetic particles. It seeks to understand fundamental solar physics and provide insights into space weather phenomena.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> The spacecraft employs a revolutionary heat shield to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation close to the Sun. It makes multiple close approaches to the Sun, eventually reaching within 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of its surface.</p>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> As of the latest information, the Parker Solar Probe continues its mission, providing unprecedented data about the Sun's behavior and environment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sun-mission">
      <h2>Solar Orbiter (ESA and NASA collaboration)</h2>
      <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> February 9, 2020</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Solar Orbiter aims to study the Sun's polar regions and provide high-resolution images of its surface and atmosphere. It will investigate solar magnetic fields, solar wind, and how the Sun influences the heliosphere, the region of space dominated by solar activity.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Solar Orbiter carries a suite of instruments, including telescopes and particle detectors, to observe the Sun from close range. It will make close approaches to the Sun, reaching within about 26 million miles (42 million kilometers).</p>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Solar Orbiter is currently operational and sending back data to Earth, contributing to our understanding of solar dynamics and space weather.</p>

    <div class="sun-mission">
      <h2>Ulysses (ESA and NASA collaboration)</h2>
      <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> October 6, 1990</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ulysses was a joint mission between NASA and ESA designed to study the Sun's polar regions and its heliosphere. It investigated the solar wind, cosmic rays, and solar magnetic fields from unique vantage points, including polar orbits.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Ulysses carried a suite of instruments to measure various properties of the solar wind and its interactions with the interstellar medium. It made multiple orbits around the Sun, including polar passes over its north and south poles.</p>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Ulysses operated successfully until its mission ended in 2009. It provided valuable data about the Sun's polar regions and its influence on the heliosphere.</p>

    <div class="sun-mission">
      <h2>Helios 1 and 2 (NASA and West Germany collaboration)</h2>
      <p><strong>Launch Dates:</strong> Helios 1: December 10, 1974; Helios 2: January 15, 1976</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The Helios missions aimed to study solar phenomena, such as the solar wind, solar magnetic fields, and solar flares, from close range. They provided important insights into solar physics and space weather.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Helios 1 and 2 were the closest spacecraft to approach the Sun, reaching within about 29 million miles (47 million kilometers). They carried a suite of instruments to measure solar radiation, magnetic fields, and charged particles.</p>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Both Helios 1 and 2 completed their missions successfully, providing valuable data about the Sun's environment and its effects on the solar system.</p>
