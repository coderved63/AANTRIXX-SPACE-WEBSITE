      <h2>Mars Missions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Mariner Program (1960s-1970s):</strong> The Mariner program, launched by NASA, consisted of a series of robotic interplanetary probes designed to explore Mars and other planets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Viking Program (1975):</strong> NASA's Viking program consisted of two spacecraft, Viking 1 and Viking 2, each consisting of an orbiter and a lander. Viking 1 and Viking 2 successfully landed on Mars in 1976, conducting experiments to search for signs of past or present life and studying the Martian surface and atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Pathfinder (1997):</strong> NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission included a lander, which deployed the Sojourner rover, the first wheeled robotic rover to explore the Martian surface. Pathfinder demonstrated a new approach for landing on Mars using airbags and provided valuable data about Martian geology and weather.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Global Surveyor (1996-2006):</strong> NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter conducted a comprehensive study of Mars, mapping its surface, studying its atmosphere, and monitoring weather patterns. It provided high-resolution images of Martian terrain and detected evidence of past water erosion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Odyssey (2001):</strong> NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter, equipped with scientific instruments, including a thermal emission imaging system and a gamma-ray spectrometer, mapped the Martian surface and studied its composition and mineralogy. It also served as a communications relay for other Mars missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Exploration Rovers (2003):</strong> NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) were launched in 2003 to explore different regions of Mars, searching for evidence of past water activity and potential signs of habitability. Both rovers exceeded their planned mission lifetimes and made significant discoveries, including evidence of ancient water environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (2005):</strong> NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is equipped with advanced scientific instruments, including high-resolution cameras and spectrometers, to study Mars' surface, atmosphere, and climate. MRO has provided detailed images of the Martian surface and identified potential landing sites for future missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Phoenix Lander (2007):</strong> NASA's Mars Phoenix Lander successfully landed near the Martian north pole in 2008 and conducted experiments to analyze soil samples and search for signs of past or present microbial life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Curiosity Rover (2011):</strong> NASA's Curiosity rover, part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, landed on Mars in 2012, with the goal of assessing Mars' past habitability and determining if the planet could have supported microbial life. Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater, analyzing rock samples, and studying the Martian climate and geology.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) (2013):</strong> NASA's MAVEN orbiter studies Mars' upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and interactions with the solar wind to understand the planet's climate history and loss of atmospheric gases.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>InSight (2018):</strong> NASA's InSight lander, equipped with instruments to study the Martian interior, such as seismometers and a heat flow probe, landed on Mars in 2018 to explore the planet's geology and seismic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Perseverance Rover (2020):</strong> NASA's Perseverance rover, part of the Mars 2020 mission, landed on Mars in February 2021, with objectives to search for signs of past microbial life, collect and cache samples for future return to Earth, and test technologies for future human exploration.
