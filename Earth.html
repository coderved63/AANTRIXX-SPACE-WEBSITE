      <h2>Space Exploration History</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Space Race (1957-1975):</strong> The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union marked the dawn of the space age.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sputnik 1 (1957):</strong> The Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit, initiating the space age and sparking the Space Race.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Yuri Gagarin (1961):</strong> Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to journey into space aboard Vostok 1, orbiting Earth once.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mercury and Gemini Programs (1961-1966):</strong> The United States launched the Mercury and Gemini programs to catch up with Soviet achievements in space exploration. Mercury sent the first Americans into space, while Gemini focused on developing techniques for orbital rendezvous and spacewalking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Apollo Program (1961-1972):</strong> The Apollo program aimed to land humans on the Moon and bring them safely back to Earth. Apollo 11, in 1969, achieved this goal with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming the first humans to walk on the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Space Shuttle Era (1981-2011):</strong> NASA's Space Shuttle program revolutionized space travel, providing a reusable spacecraft for missions into low Earth orbit. It facilitated satellite deployment, space station construction, and scientific research.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>International Space Station (ISS) (1998-Present):</strong> The ISS is a collaborative effort among multiple space agencies, including NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA. It serves as a microgravity research laboratory and a platform for international cooperation in space exploration.

    <div class="spacecraft-satellites">
      <h2>Spacecraft and Satellites</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Voyager Probes (1977):</strong> NASA launched the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes to study the outer planets of our solar system. Both spacecraft continue to send data as they explore interstellar space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hubble Space Telescope (1990):</strong> Launched into orbit by the Space Shuttle Discovery, the Hubble Space Telescope has provided stunning images and invaluable data about the universe, revolutionizing our understanding of astronomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars Rovers (2004-Present):</strong> NASA's Mars rovers, including Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity, have explored the Martian surface, searching for evidence of past water and signs of potential habitability.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SpaceX Dragon and Crew Dragon:</strong> SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the ISS. Crew Dragon, its crewed counterpart, ferries astronauts to and from the ISS under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Chang'e Missions (China):</strong> China's Chang'e program includes orbiters, landers, and rovers aimed at lunar exploration. Chang'e 4, launched in 2019, became the first mission to successfully land on the far side of the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Satellite Constellations:</strong> Companies like SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon are deploying large constellations of satellites to provide global broadband internet coverage. These constellations raise concerns about space debris and light pollution.
