      <h2>Mariner 10 (1974-1975)</h2>
      <p><strong>Mission Objectives:</strong> Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Mercury. Its primary objectives were to map the surface, study Mercury's atmosphere and magnetic field, and characterize its geological features.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mariner 10 provided the first close-up images of Mercury, revealing a heavily cratered surface similar to the Moon's.</li>
        <li>It discovered Mercury's thin atmosphere, composed mainly of helium, with traces of hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and potassium.</li>
        <li>Mariner 10 also confirmed the presence of a weak magnetic field around Mercury, suggesting the existence of an iron-rich core.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>MESSENGER (2004-2015)</h2>
      <p><strong>Mission Objectives:</strong> The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission aimed to orbit and extensively study Mercury to understand its composition, magnetic field, geology, and history.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>MESSENGER discovered water ice and organic molecules in permanently shadowed regions near Mercury's poles.</li>
        <li>It provided detailed maps of Mercury's surface, revealing diverse geological features such as volcanic plains, cliffs, and crater formations.</li>
        <li>The mission confirmed the presence of a global magnetic field and a partially liquid outer core, challenging previous theories about Mercury's internal structure.</li>
        <li>MESSENGER also investigated Mercury's exosphere, the thin atmosphere surrounding the planet, and studied its interaction with the solar wind.</li>
